Version control systems allow developers to work collaboratively and effectively. The ability to track changes and merge those changes across multiple knowledge workers and multiple computers to arrive at a final developed product requires strong communication and effective development processes. 

The ability to control the versions of the development is version control. Version control systems (VCS) are required. These systems allow for revision control and source control management. It allows for multiple team members to be working simultaneously without the risk of work being lost. One main repository for the files serves to manage changes. Files cannot be overwritten, members can work simultaneously, and projects are backed up. The central respository allows developers to record their change histories, and track their status and versions. Two repositories work together in the system, which are the remote repository and the local repository. The remote repository resides on a remote server that is shared among team members. The local repository resides on a local computer of the individual user.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you have a browser and the ability to download zip files, then establishing a workspace utilizing cloud software is not only possible, but it is ideal. Gone are the days of downloading programs to your local computer in order to create a workspace to learn. Knowing which cloud tools and services to use and how to do it is the key. In this lesson, web development students are required to establish a GitHub account because it is the go-to place for web development collaboration at the time of this course. (That could change in the future given the rich abundance of technology advancements and yet-to-be-known tech genius in the pike! But for now, millions of developers depend on it.) Setting up the student workspace in order to practice and learn web application fundamentals requires a good deal of knowledge and preparation. A Cloud9 workspace is created to serve as the local repository. The workspace in Cloud9 has to be configured properly so that files (downloaded from a Dropbox zip file and then uploaded into the Cloud9 workspace) can be moved between the local (Cloud9) and the remote (GitHub) repositories. This student workspace is the groundwork for implementing the lesson concepts of using Git for version control: Add, Commit, Push.</p>

            <p class="lead">What is GIT? According to the GIT website (which is an open sourced site hosted on GitHub), GIT is explained as a distributed version control system that allows version control. "Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system" (TryGit, 2018). GIT utilizes a distributed version control system where every user has a copy of the repository data on their local computer. So developers can work offline and then sync when they access the internet again. Processes are fast and no single server holds the power to crash a project. An understanding of the basic commands of GIT needs to be mastered. GIT has three states that are applied to all files: committed, modified, or staged. Committed files means that data is stored on the local database. Modified means that files have been changed, but are not yet committed to the database. And, staged means that the file is ready to be pushed to the next commit action. <hr/>References<br/>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT gives you version control and GetHub allows you to apply it. You need version control to successfully develop with a team. Starting with a working directory, the repository is initialized with the command, "GIT INIT". The remote repository is stored with GetHub. The command, "GIT ADD ." adds all of the files to the staging area (on the local machine) preparing them to pushed to the remote repository when ready. The command, "GIT COMMIT -M "..."" commits changes to the local repository. Now the changes are bundled and ready to be pushed to the remote repository using the command, "GIT PUSH". The remote repository resides with GitHub. Multiple developers can push their changes from their local repositories into the remote repository in GitHub simultaneously. And all of those collective changes are merged and then pulled back into the local repository through the command, "GIT PULL". The cycle continues and there is a symbiotic relationship between the concepts and the GIT approach and the working environment of application with GitHub.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Lesson 3 focused on version control. Topics covered included version control, version control systems, advantages of using a VCS for developers, the basic GIT commands of commit, push, pull, clone, etc., and how to create a local and remote repository using GitHub. Reading assignments pointed to GIT resources pulled directly from an open-sourced site hosted by GitHub called GIT --everything is local (https://git-scm.com/). Lecture videos from the instructor and also from an expert in the GIT field, Matthew McCullough with GetHub, covered GIT concepts and verson control systems. Bringing the concepts of GIT together with using GitHub allows students to apply the lesson content. In the Cloud9 account, a local repository was established by following assignment directions to download a zip file from Dropbox which contained a bootstrap website. A GitHub account was established and configuration between the Cloud9 workspace and GitHub was required in order to create the remote repository with GitHub. The full lesson three concepts were finalized by building out the bootstrap framework into a webpage that summarized five concepts from the lesson.</p>
